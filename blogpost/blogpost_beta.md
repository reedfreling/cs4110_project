# CS4110 Project Beta Blog Post
by Reed Freling and Samuel Levenson


## Vision

For our project, we wanted to create an interpreter for a [modal logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/) domain specific  
language and to prove the correctness of our implementation using the proof assistent [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).


Our language would first include the necessary components of propositional logic, such as  
basic logical connectives and propositional variables. Then we would add the two basic  
modal logic operators, &#x25a1; and &#x25c7;. We also wanted to give the user the ability to define a  
[Kripke Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_structure_(model_checking)) and to check the validity of modal logic expressions on a given model.
